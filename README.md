# AdventOfCode-2015

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015 "Advent of Code 2015") written in Go.

## How to run

`go run day##/cmd/day##/main.go <input_file>`

Replace `##` with the number day you want to run.

e.g. `go run day01/cmd/day01/main.go day01/input01.txt`

## Testing

`go test ./...`
